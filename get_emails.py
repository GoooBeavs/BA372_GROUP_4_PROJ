#Python program which retrieves ONID email from LDAP using user's first and last
#name.
#
#Since the program requires ONID username and password to connect to ONID LDAP,
#username and password must be stored in a file using the following format:
#
#user=onid_user_id
#password=onid_password
#
#Instead of hardwiring these credentials in the program, we store them in a (credentials) file and 
#pass the file to the program on the command-line.
#
#In this version of the program, the first and last name of the ONID user whose
#email we want are also passed on the command line.
#
#Example: if the credentials file is 'z:\credentials.txt' and we are looking for
#the email of Logan Steele, we call the program on the command-line as follows:
#
#python ldap_query_for_onid.py z:\credentials.txt Logan Steele
